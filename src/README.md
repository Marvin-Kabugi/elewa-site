# App Structure
### Before running the app make sure you are connected to the internet. Some resources are hosted in the cloud and require internet to be downloaded
### Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

The application's root directory has three directories which are public, src and node_modules.

The applications source code is in the src directory which has two child directories: `components` and `pages`

The `component` directory has other directories containing reusable components and their appropriate styles.

The `pages` directory has files specific to a page and the relevant styles.
